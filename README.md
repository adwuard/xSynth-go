# xSynth-go
Portable FPGA based Synthesizer/DSP processor on Digilent CMOD A7 35T FPGA

# Overview
This project focuses on creating a portable hardware platform for hardware interactions with the XFM2 original created by Ren√© Ceballos. The hardware is also designed for portability and scalability in mind. The idea is to, not only
work with XFM2. This is also useful an open hardware for FPGA DSP/Synth development. Capable for audio signal in/out and MIDI in/out. This is scalable for anyone who want to design custom FPGA effect processor, or for anyone who are interested in just learning FPGA signal processing.

### Key Features:
- Hardware compatible with [XFM DIY Synthesizer](https://www.futur3soundz.com/xfm2/) by Ren√© Ceballos
- Powerful [Digilent CMOD A7 35T FPGA](https://digilent.com/shop/cmod-a7-35t-breadboardable-artix-7-fpga-module/)
- MIDI In (Type A)
- MIDI Thru/Out (Type A)
- Line-In/Out 3.5mm Jack
- USB-C Powered
- USB Device mode (capable in `UI FPC connector`)
- All additional pin-outs is wired out to FPC for off board expansions 
- All control pinouts that is needed for hardware UI interface is connected via one FPC

*** Future Supports:
- USB MIDI Device via Type-C
- Hardware UI controller (screen and mechanical keyboard) for user interactions
- Micro-SD card for patch storage.
