# xSynth-go
A portable FPGA-based Synthesizer/DSP processor built on the Digilent CMOD A7 35T FPGA.

## Overview
This project aims to create a portable hardware platform for interacting with the XFM2, originally created by Ren√© Ceballos. The hardware is designed with portability and scalability in mind, making it not only compatible with XFM2 but also a useful open hardware platform for FPGA DSP/Synth development. It is capable of audio signal input/output and MIDI input/output, making it scalable for those who want to design custom FPGA effect processors, or for those interested in learning FPGA signal processing.

## Hardware Build

### System block diagram
- `FPGA baseboard`: Left section of the system diagram. The design is completed and can work as standalone unit and be controlled over MIDI and UART interface.
- `MCU board`: Right section of the system diagram. It is for screen/keyboard UI controls and USB MIDI device. Hardware design is still "work in progress".

## Key Features:
- Compatibility with [XFM DIY Synthesizer](https://www.futur3soundz.com/xfm2/) by Ren√© Ceballos.
- Utilizes the powerful [Digilent CMOD A7 35T FPGA](https://digilent.com/shop/cmod-a7-35t-breadboardable-artix-7-fpga-module/).
- MIDI In (Type A) and MIDI Thru/Out (Type A).
- Line-In/Out 3.5mm Jack.
- USB-C Powered.
- USB Device mode (available in `UI FPC connector`).
- All additional pin-outs are wired out to FPC for off-board expansions.
- All control pinouts needed for hardware UI interface are connected via one FPC.

### Future Supports:
- USB MIDI Device via Type-C.
- Hardware UI controller (screen and mechanical keyboard) for user interactions.
- Micro-SD card for patch storage.
